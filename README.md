# <h1 align="center"> An EigenLayer AVS üåê </h1>

**A simple Hello World AVS for EigenLayer with the BLS-based Contract Configuration**

## üìö Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)

You will also need to install [cargo-tangle](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tangle), our CLI tool for creating and
deploying Tangle Blueprints:

To install the Tangle CLI, run the following command:

> Supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (WSL2)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle-v0.1.2/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

Or, if you prefer to install the CLI from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tangle --force # to get the latest version.
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Once `cargo-tangle` is installed, you can create a new project with the following command:

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint create --name <project-name> --eigenlayer <type>
```
where `<project-name>` is the name of the project that will be generated, and `<type>` is BLS or ECDSA. If you aren't sure which type to use, you likely want the default: BLS. If you don't specify a type, it will default to BLS.

## üìö Overview

This project is about creating a simple Hello World AVS for EigenLayer.
An AVS (Actively Validated Service) is an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time.
